Gonna do, gotta do, gonna impress all your friends
And the groovin' is all up to your attention
Take her up, take her down, take her to a dead end
Let the steamin' come up
Better bet, better get, better let her the game
And the mood is all up into your actions
All alone like a bone you can stick to the phone and tell ya lady

Gonna do, gotta do, gonna impress all your friends
And the groovin' is all up to your attention
Me and you in Paradise
Take her up, take her down, take her to a dead end
Let the steamin' come up
Better bet, better get, better let her the game
And the mood is all up into your actions
Can't you see the sun arise?
All alone like a bone you can stick to the phone and tell ya lady

Orient Express from London to Cairo
Express - Express
Orient Express return to survival
Express - Express
With just a chance, the last
From Venice to Paris
Without a glance, no past
From Venice to Paris

Gonna do, gotta do, gonna impress all your friends
And the groovin' is all up to your attention
Win or lose, it's just the same
Take her up, take her down, take her to a dead end
Let the steamin' come up
Better bet, better get, better let her the game
And the mood is all up into your actions
All alone like a bone you can stick to the phone and tell ya lady
