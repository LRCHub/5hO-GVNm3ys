Your backpack in the corner of the room
You're gone but you'll be more gone soon
You linger like the scent of some perfume
Or an angel who has stained my sheets
I won't be washing [them] for at least a week
Then the smell of you and half asleep
I'm watching you get dressed
I'm watching you get dressed
I'm watching you get dressed
I'm watching you get dressed.

We could go out, make out at some bar
Or throw a party instead
Or we could stay right where we are
And have McDonald's in bed
The way your face changed in front of the mirror
I feel like I never know which of you is the real
I think to myself as I'm watching you get dressed
Watching you get dressed...

Take a ride on the American Express
Watching you get dressed
The American dream - I say "Hell yeah!"
Watching you get dressed
Watching you get dressed.

You think I'll hang around and wait for your car?
Well I just might.
I want to be around to see you call
In the middle of the night.
I'll be the one... who's gonna be watching you undress
Watching you undress.

Take a ride on the American Express
Watching you undress
The American dream - I say "Hell yeah!"
Watching you undress
Watching you undress
Watching you undress.

There's an action on TV
But I would rather be
Watching you undress
Watching you undress
Watching you undress.
